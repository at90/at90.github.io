                    <p>Salesforce Enterprise comes with a ton of features, workflows and opportunities for integrations. I can have your instance set up to match your organization's requirements in a days time. I'd been working with a Salesforce ISV building advanced reporting for banking institutions. A good rule of thumb is to design for ease of reporting, in addition to the custom objects and triggers that you'd need.</p>

                    <p>Along with the new set of reporting that you'd like, I can also have them built on a neat Dashboard complete with Charts and Metrics. You will be able to see the most relevant info the moment you login so you can quickly identify bottlenecks in performance. </p>
